	<p style="color: brown" align="center">I'm a Junior at Parsons, majoring in Strategic Design and Management and double minoring in communication design and fashion communication. I am an international student from Singapore. I am taking Web Design Basics, to get a better understanding of the basics of coding, design layouts and how to apply typography for web design. I think it is necessary for me to have a background in web design, especially for advertising and branding!</p>
